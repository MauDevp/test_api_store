Pagination
APIs that use offset-based paging use the offset and limit query parameters to paginate through items in a collection.

Offset-based pagination is often used where the list of items is of a fixed and predetermined length.

To fetch the first page of entries in a collection, the API needs to be called with the offset set to 0 and the limit the products that you want in the response.

Request:

[GET] https://api.escuelajs.co/api/v1/products?offset=0&limit=10
Response:

[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Handmade Fresh Table",
    "price": 687,
    "description": "Andy shoes are designed to keeping in...",
    "category": {
      "id": 5,
      "name": "Others",
      "image": "https://placeimg.com/640/480/any?r=0.591926261873231"
    },
    "images": [
      "https://placeimg.com/640/480/any?r=0.9178516507833767",
      "https://placeimg.com/640/480/any?r=0.9300320592588625",
      "https://placeimg.com/640/480/any?r=0.8807778235430017"
    ]
  }
  // ... and 9 items more
]
To fetch the next page of entries, the API needs to be called with an offset parameter that equals the sum of the previous offset value and limit returned to the previous result,

To get the next page of entries, use an offset parameter equal to the sum of the previous offset value and the limit returned to the previous result, previous_offset + previous_limit.

[GET] https://api.escuelajs.co/api/v1/products?offset=10&limit=10
Note that the offset should be increased by the previous limit and not by the size of the entries in the response array, as this may be less than the limit. Generally, we advise using the value of the limit in the response object to increase the offset value.

For example, for a pagination with 10 items per page, it looks like this:

Request	Description
/products?offset=0&limit=10	Return the first 10 products.
/products?offset=10&limit=10	Return products from 10 to 20
/products?offset=20&limit=10	Return products from 20 to 30
Or for a pagination with 20 items per page, it looks like this:

Request	Description
/products?offset=0&limit=20	Return the first 20 products.
/products?offset=20&limit=20	Return products from 20 to 40
/products?offset=40&limit=20	Return products from 40 to 60
Schema Product
Attribute	Type	Description
id	number	The id of the product.
title	string	The name of the product.
price	number	Price the product.
description	string	Description the product.
category	number	Object of category.
